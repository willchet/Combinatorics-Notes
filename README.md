This repository contains my notes related to combinatorics, based primarily on MTH 481 and 482 at Michigan State University. The topics include some elementary combinatorics, set partitions and compositions, combinatorial classes and labelled structures, and various inversion formulas (including Mobius and Lagrange Inversion). Feel free to add issues or pull requests to the repo if you find mistakes or want to add content.
